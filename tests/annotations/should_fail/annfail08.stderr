    No instance for (Data.Data.Data (a0 -> a0))
      arising from an annotation
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Data.Data.Data (a0 -> a0))
    In the expression: (id + 1)
    In the annotation: {-# ANN f (id + 1) #-}

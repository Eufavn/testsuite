<interactive>:5:1:
    No instance for (Show (t -> a))
      arising from a use of `print'
    Cannot resolve unknown runtime types `t', `a'
    Use :print or :force to determine these types
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (t -> a))
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it

    Couldn't match expected type `s' against inferred type `t'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `g' at tcfail103.hs:13:17
      `t' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `f' at tcfail103.hs:10:8
      Expected type: STRef s Int
      Inferred type: STRef t Int
    In the first argument of `readSTRef', namely `v'
    In the expression: readSTRef v

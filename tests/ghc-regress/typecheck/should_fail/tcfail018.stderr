tcfail018.hs:5:
    No instance for (Num [a])
      arising from the literal `1' at tcfail018.hs:5
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      a :: a (bound at tcfail018.hs:5)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
    In a pattern binding: (a : []) = 1

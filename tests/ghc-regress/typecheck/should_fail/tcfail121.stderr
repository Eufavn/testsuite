    Overlapping instances for Foo [a]
      arising from use of `op' at tcfail121.hs:12:8-9
    Matching instances:
      instance [overlap ok] (Foo a) => Foo [a] -- Defined at tcfail121.hs:8:0
      instance [overlap ok] Foo [Int] -- Defined at tcfail121.hs:9:0
    (The choice depends on the instantiation of `a'
     Use -fallow-incoherent-instances to use the first choice above)
    In the definition of `foo': foo x = op x

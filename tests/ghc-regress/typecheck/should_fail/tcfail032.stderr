    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `a' escapes
	It is mentioned in the environment
	The following variables in the environment mention `a'
	  x :: a -> Int
    Signature type:     forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int
    Type to generalise: a -> Int
    When checking an expression type signature
    In an expression with a type signature:
	  x :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int

    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
    Quantified type variable `a' escapes
    It is mentioned in the environment:
      x :: a -> Int (bound at tcfail032.hs:14)
    Signature type:     forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int
    Type to generalise: a -> Int
    In an expression with a type signature:
	  x :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int
    In the definition of `f': (x :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int)

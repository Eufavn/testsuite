    Couldn't match type `t' with `a -> Int'
      because type variable `a' would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      an expression type signature
    The following variables have types that mention t
      x :: t (bound at tcfail032.hs:14:3)
    In the expression: (x :: Eq a => a -> Int)
    In an equation for `f': f x = (x :: Eq a => a -> Int)

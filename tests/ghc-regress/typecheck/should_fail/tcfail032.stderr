    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `a' escapes
	It is mentioned in the environment:
	  x :: a -> Int (bound at tcfail032.hs:14)
    When checking the type signature of the expression:
	  x :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int
    In the definition of `f': f x = (x :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> Int)

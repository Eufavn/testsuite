tcfail102.hs:8:6:
    Could not deduce (Integral (Ratio a)) from the context (Integral a)
      arising from a record update at tcfail102.hs:8:6-18
    Probable fix:
      Add (Integral (Ratio a)) to the type signature(s) for `f'
      Or add an instance declaration for (Integral (Ratio a))
    In the record update: x {p = p x}
    In the definition of `f': f x = x {p = p x}

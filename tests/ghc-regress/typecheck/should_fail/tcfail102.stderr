tcfail102.hs:8:
    Could not deduce (Integral (Ratio a)) from the context (Integral a)
    Probable fix:
	Add (Integral (Ratio a)) to the type signature(s) for f
	Or add an instance declaration for (Integral (Ratio a))
    arising from a record update at tcfail102.hs:8
    In the record update: x {p = p x}
    In the definition of `f': x {p = p x}

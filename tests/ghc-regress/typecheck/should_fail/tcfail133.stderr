    No instance for (AddDigit ((:@) Zero ((:@) One One)) One t)
      arising from use of `add' at tcfail133.hs:67:13-38
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (AddDigit ((:@) Zero
						      ((:@) One One))
						One
						t)
    In the call (add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One))
    In the second argument of `($)', namely
	`add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)'
    In the expression: show $ (add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One))

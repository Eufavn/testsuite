tcfail133.hs:67:13:
    No instance for (AddDigit ((:@) Zero ((:@) One One)) One a)
      arising from use of `add' at tcfail133.hs:67:13-15
    Probable fix:
      add an instance declaration for (AddDigit ((:@) Zero ((:@) One One)) One a)
    In the second argument of `($)', namely `add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)'
    In the definition of `foo': foo = show $ (add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One))

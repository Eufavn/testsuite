    No instance for (Eq (Pid -> Time -> Message a -> (MessList a, Continuation a)))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration at tcfail046.hs:9:8
    Probable fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Eq (Pid
					   -> Time
					   -> Message a
					   -> (MessList a, Continuation a)))
    When deriving the `Eq' instance for type `Continuation'

tcfail019.hs:18:
    Could not deduce (C [a], B [a]) from the context ()
      arising from the instance declaration at tcfail019.hs:18
    Probable fix:
	Add (C [a], B [a]) to the instance declaration superclass context
	Or add an instance declaration for (C [a], B [a])
    In the instance declaration for `D [a]'

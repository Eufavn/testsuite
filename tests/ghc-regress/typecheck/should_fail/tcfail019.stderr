tcfail019.hs:18:0:
    No instances for (B [a], C [a])
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration at tcfail019.hs:18:0
    Probable fix:
      add (B [a], C [a]) to the instance declaration superclass context
      or add an instance declaration for (B [a], C [a])
    In the instance declaration for `D [a]'

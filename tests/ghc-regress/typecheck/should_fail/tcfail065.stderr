    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `x1' is unified with another quantified type variable `x'
    When trying to generalise the type inferred for `setX'
	Signature type:     forall x1 x2. x2 -> X x1 -> X x1
	Type to generalise: forall x2. x2 -> X x1 -> X x1
    In the instance declaration for `HasX (X x)'

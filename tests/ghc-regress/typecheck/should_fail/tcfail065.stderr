    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `x' is unified with another quantified type variable `x'
    Signature type:     forall x. x -> X x1 -> X x1
    Type to generalise: x -> X x -> X x
    When checking the type signature for `setX'
    When generalising the type(s) for setX
    In the definition for method `setX'

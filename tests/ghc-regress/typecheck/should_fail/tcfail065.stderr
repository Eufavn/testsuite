    Couldn't match the rigid variable `x' against the rigid variable `x1'
      `x' is bound by the instance declaration at tcfail065.hs:28:0
      `x1' is bound by the type signature for `setX'
      Expected type: x
      Inferred type: x1
    In the first argument of `X', namely `x'
    In the definition of `setX': setX x (X _) = X x

tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail042.hs:15:
    Could not deduce `Num a' from the context (Eq a, Show a)
    Probable fix:
	Add `Num a' to the instance declaration context
    arising from the instance declaration at tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail042.hs:15
    In the instance declaration for `Bar [a]'

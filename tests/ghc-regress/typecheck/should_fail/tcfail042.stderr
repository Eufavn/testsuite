    Could not deduce (Num a) from the context (Eq a, Show a)
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
                   at tcfail042.hs:15:9-33
    Possible fix:
      add (Num a) to the context of the instance declaration
    In the instance declaration for `Bar [a]'

tcfail042.hs:17:17:
    Could not deduce (Num a) from the context (Eq a, Show a)
      arising from a use of `foo' at tcfail042.hs:17:17-22
    Possible fix:
      add (Num a) to the context of the type signature for `bar'
    In the expression: foo xs
    In the definition of `bar':
        bar (x : xs)
              = foo xs
              where
                  u = x == x
                  v = show x
    In the instance declaration for `Bar [a]'

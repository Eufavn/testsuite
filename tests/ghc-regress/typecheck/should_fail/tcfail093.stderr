tcfail093.hs:14:
    No instance for (Call (IO Int) h)
      arising from use of `call' at tcfail093.hs:14
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      dup :: () -> Int -> h (bound at tcfail093.hs:14)
    In a right-hand side of function `dup': call primDup
    In the definition of `dup': dup () = call primDup

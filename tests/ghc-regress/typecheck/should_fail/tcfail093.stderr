tcfail093.hs:14:9:
    No instance for (Call (IO Int) h)
      arising from use of `call' at tcfail093.hs:14:9-12
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      dup :: () -> Int -> h (bound at tcfail093.hs:14:0)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
    In the definition of `dup': dup () = call primDup

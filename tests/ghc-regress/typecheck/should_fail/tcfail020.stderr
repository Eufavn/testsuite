tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail020.hs:10:
    Could not deduce `A [a]' from the context (A a)
    Probable fix:
	Add `A [a]' to the instance declaration context
	Or add an instance declaration for `A [a]'
    arising from the instance declaration at tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail020.hs:10
    In the instance declaration for `B [a]'

    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      (ORD a) arising from a use of `<<'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `(===)', namely `(<<)'
    In the expression: (<<) === (<<)
    In the definition of `f': f = (<<) === (<<)

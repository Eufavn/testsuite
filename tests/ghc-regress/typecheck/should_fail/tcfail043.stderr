tcfail043.hs:15:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in these top-level constraint
      `Ord_ a' arising from use of `gt' at tcfail043.hs:38
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      search :: a -> [a] -> Bool (bound at tcfail043.hs:38)
    Probable fix: give these definitions an explicit type signature

tcfail034.hs:17:
    Could not deduce (Integral a) from the context (Num a, Eq a)
      arising from use of `mod' at tcfail034.hs:17
    Probable fix:
	Add (Integral a) to the type signature(s) for `test'
    In the first argument of `(==)', namely `(x `mod` 3)'
    In the definition of `test': test x = (x `mod` 3) == 0

tcfail034.hs:17:
    Could not deduce (Integral a) from the context (Num a, Eq a)
    Probable fix:
	Add (Integral a) to the type signature(s) for `test'
    arising from use of `mod' at tcfail034.hs:17
    In the first argument of `(==)', namely `(x `mod` 3)'
    In a right-hand side of function `test': (x `mod` 3) == 0

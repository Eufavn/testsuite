tcfail010.hs:3:
    No instance for (Num [a])
      arising from use of `+' at tcfail010.hs:3
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      q :: [a] -> [a] (bound at tcfail010.hs:3)
    In the body of a lambda: z + 2
    In a lambda abstraction: \ (y : z) -> z + 2
    In a right-hand side of function `q': \ (y : z) -> z + 2

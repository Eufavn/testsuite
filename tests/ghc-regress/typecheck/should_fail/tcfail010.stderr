tcfail010.hs:3:17:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraint:
      `Num [a]' arising from the literal `2' at tcfail010.hs:3:17
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      q :: [a] -> [a] (bound at tcfail010.hs:3:0)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
		  or use -fno-monomorphism-restriction

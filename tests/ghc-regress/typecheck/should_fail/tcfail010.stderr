    No instance for (Num [a])
      arising from the literal `2' at tcfail010.hs:3:17
    Probable fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [a])
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `2'
    In a lambda abstraction: \ (y : z) -> z + 2
    In the definition of `q': q = \ (y : z) -> z + 2

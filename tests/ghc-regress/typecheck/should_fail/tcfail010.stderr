tcfail010.hs:3:16:
    No instance for (Num [a])
      arising from use of `+' at tcfail010.hs:3:16
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      q :: [a] -> [a] (bound at tcfail010.hs:3:0)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
    In a lambda abstraction: \ (y : z) -> z + 2
    In the definition of `q': q = \ (y : z) -> z + 2

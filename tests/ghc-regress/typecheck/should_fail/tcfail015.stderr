tcfail015.hs:8:32:
    No instance for (Num Bool)
      arising from the literal `1' at tcfail015.hs:8:32
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num Bool)
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: c + 1
    In the definition of `g':
	g (ANode b (ANode c d))
	    | b = c + 1
	    | otherwise = 4

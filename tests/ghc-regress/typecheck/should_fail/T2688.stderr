    Couldn't match type `v' with `s'
      `v' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the class declaration for `VectorSpace' at T2688.hs:5:19
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the class declaration for `VectorSpace' at T2688.hs:5:21
    In the expression: v *^ (1 / s)
    In an equation for `^/': v ^/ s = v *^ (1 / s)

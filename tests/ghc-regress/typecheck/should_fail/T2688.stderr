    Could not deduce (VectorSpace s s)
      from the context (VectorSpace v s)
      arising from a use of `*^'
    Possible fix:
      add (VectorSpace s s) to the context of
        the class declaration for `VectorSpace'
    In the expression: v *^ (1 / s)
    In an equation for `^/': v ^/ s = v *^ (1 / s)

    Could not deduce (Fractional s) from the context (VectorSpace v s)
      arising from a use of `/'
    Possible fix:
      add (Fractional s) to the context of
        the class declaration for `VectorSpace'
    In the second argument of `(*^)', namely `(1 / s)'
    In the expression: v *^ (1 / s)
    In an equation for `^/': v ^/ s = v *^ (1 / s)

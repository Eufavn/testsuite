    Mismatched contexts
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for
      f :: forall d. (Ord d) => d -> d
      g :: forall e. e -> e
    The signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical
    When generalising the type(s) for f, g

tcfail071.hs:10:21:
    Cannot unify the type-signature variable `e' with the type `t -> t1'
	Expected type: a -> b -> b
	Inferred type: e
    In the first argument of `f', namely `c'
    In the first argument of `foldr', namely `(f c)'

    Contexts differ in length
    When matching the contexts of the signatures for
      f :: forall d. (Ord d) => d -> d
      g :: forall e. e -> e
    The signature contexts in a mutually recursive group should all be identical
    When generalising the type(s) for f, g

tcfail071.hs:10:21:
    Couldn't match the rigid variable `e' against `a -> b -> b'
      `e' is bound by the type signature for `g'
      Expected type: a -> b -> b
      Inferred type: e
    In the first argument of `f', namely `c'
    In the first argument of `foldr', namely `(f c)'

tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail017.hs:10:
    Could not deduce `C [a]' from the context (B a)
    Probable fix:
	Add `C [a]' to the instance declaration context
	Or add an instance declaration for `C [a]'
    arising from the instance declaration at tests/ghc-regress/typecheck/should_fail/tcfail017.hs:10
    In the instance declaration for `B [a]'

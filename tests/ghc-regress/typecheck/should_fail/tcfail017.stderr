tcfail017.hs:10:0:
    Could not deduce (C [a]) from the context (B a)
      arising from the instance declaration at tcfail017.hs:10:0
    Probable fix:
      Add (C [a]) to the instance declaration superclass context
      Or add an instance declaration for (C [a])
    In the instance declaration for `B [a]'

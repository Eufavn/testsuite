    Probable fix:
	Add (Ord a) to the type signature(s) for `subRangeValue'

    Probable fix:
	Add (Ord a) to the type signature(s) for `subRange'

    Could not deduce (Show (SubRange a)) from the context (Num a)
    Probable fix:

    arising from the instance declaration at tcfail067.hs:60
    In the instance declaration for `Num (SubRange a)'

    Probable fix:

    Probable fix:

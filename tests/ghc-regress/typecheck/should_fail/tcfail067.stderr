tcfail067.hs:60:
    Could not deduce (Show (SubRange a)) from the context (Num a)
    Probable fix:
	Add (Show (SubRange a)) to the instance declaration context
	Or add an instance declaration for (Show (SubRange a))
    arising from the instance declaration at tcfail067.hs:60
    In the instance declaration for `Num (SubRange a)'

tcfail067.hs:61:
    Could not deduce (Ord a)
	from the context (Num (SubRange a),
			  Num a,
			  Eq (SubRange a),
			  Show (SubRange a))
    Probable fix:
	Add (Ord a) to the instance declaration context
    arising from use of `numSubRangeNegate' at tcfail067.hs:61
    In the definition of `negate': numSubRangeNegate

tcfail067.hs:74:
    Could not deduce (Ord a) from the context (Num a)
    Probable fix:
	Add (Ord a) to the type signature(s) for `numSubRangeBinOp'
    arising from use of `SubRange' at tcfail067.hs:74
    In the definition of `numSubRangeBinOp':
	SubRange (result, result) result

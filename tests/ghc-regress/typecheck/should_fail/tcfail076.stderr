tcfail076.hs:18:
    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
    Quantified type variable `res' escapes
    It unifies with `res1', which is mentioned in the environment:
      cont :: a -> m res1 (bound at tcfail076.hs:18)
    Signature type:     forall res. (a1 -> m1 res) -> m1 res
    Type to generalise: (a1 -> m res1) -> m res1
    In the first argument of `KContT', namely `(\ cont' -> cont a)'
    In a lambda abstraction: KContT (\ cont' -> cont a)

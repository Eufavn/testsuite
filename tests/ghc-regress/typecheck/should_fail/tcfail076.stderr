    Inferred type is less polymorphic than expected
	Quantified type variable `res' escapes
	It is mentioned in the environment:
	  cont :: a -> m res (bound at tcfail076.hs:18:36)
    In the first argument of `KContT', namely `(\ cont' -> cont a)'
    In a lambda abstraction: \ a -> KContT (\ cont' -> cont a)
    In the first argument of `f', namely `(\ a -> KContT (\ cont' -> cont a))'

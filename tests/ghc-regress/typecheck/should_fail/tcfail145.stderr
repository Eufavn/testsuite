    Couldn't match expected type `a' (a rigid variable)
       against inferred type `[a]'
    When matching `forall a. [a] -> [a]'
              and `forall a. a -> a'
      Expected type: forall a1. a1 -> a1
      Inferred type: forall a1. [a1] -> [a1]
    In the pattern: f :: forall a. [a] -> [a]

tcfail008.hs:3:
    No instance for (Num [a])
      arising from the literal `2' at tcfail008.hs:3
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      o :: [a] (bound at tcfail008.hs:3)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
    In the second argument of `(:)', namely `2'
    In a right-hand side of function `o': 1 : 2
    In the definition of `o': o = 1 : 2

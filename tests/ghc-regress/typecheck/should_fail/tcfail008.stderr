tcfail008.hs:3:6:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraints:
      `Num [a]' arising from the literal `2' at tcfail008.hs:3:6
      `Num a' arising from the literal `1' at tcfail008.hs:3:4
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      o :: [a] (bound at tcfail008.hs:3:0)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
		  or use -fno-monomorphism-restriction

    Couldn't match expected type `s' (a rigid variable)
	   against inferred type `x' (a rigid variable)
      `s' is bound by the type signature for `run' at tcfail179.hs:12:9
      `x' is bound by the constructor `T' at tcfail179.hs:14:13
    In the second argument of `g', namely `id'
    In the expression: g x id
    In a pattern binding: (x, _, b) = g x id

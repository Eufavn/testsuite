    Couldn't match expected type `s' against inferred type `x'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the type signature for `run' at tcfail179.hs:12:9
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the constructor `T' at tcfail179.hs:14:13
      Expected type: (s, s, Int)
      Inferred type: (x, s, Int)
    In the expression: g x id
    In a pattern binding: (x, _, b) = g x id

    Couldn't match expected type `s' against inferred type `x'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `run' at tcfail179.hs:12:10
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the constructor `T' at tcfail179.hs:14:14
    In the second argument of `g', namely `id'
    In the expression: g x id
    In a pattern binding: (x, _, b) = g x id

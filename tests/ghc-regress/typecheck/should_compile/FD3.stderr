    Could not deduce (MkA (String, a) a) from the context ()
      arising from a use of `mkA' at FD3.hs:22:14-18
    Possible fix:
      add (MkA (String, a) a) to the context of
	the type signature for `translate'
      or add an instance declaration for (MkA (String, a) a)
    In the expression: mkA a
    In the definition of `translate': translate a = mkA a

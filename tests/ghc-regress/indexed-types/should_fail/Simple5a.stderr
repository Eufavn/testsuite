Simple5a.hs:31:10:
    Couldn't match expected type `a' against inferred type `Int'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the type signature for `bar3wrong' at Simple5a.hs:30:16
    In the pattern: D3Int
    In the definition of `bar3wrong': bar3wrong D3Int = 1

Simple5a.hs:31:19:
    Could not deduce (Num a) from the context ()
      arising from the literal `1' at Simple5a.hs:31:19
    Possible fix:
      add (Num a) to the context of the type signature for `bar3wrong'
    In the expression: 1
    In the definition of `bar3wrong': bar3wrong D3Int = 1

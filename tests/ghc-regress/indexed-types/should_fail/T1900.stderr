T1900.hs:11:13:
    No instance for (Num ())
      arising from the literal `1'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num ())
    In the second argument of `(+)', namely `1'
    In the expression: (+ 1)
    In an equation for `trans': trans = (+ 1)

T1900.hs:14:16:
    Could not deduce (Depend s ~ Depend s1) from the context (Bug s1)
    NB: `Depend' is a type function, and may not be injective
    In the second argument of `(==)', namely `trans d'
    In the expression: d == trans d
    In an equation for `check': check d = d == trans d

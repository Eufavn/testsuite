    Couldn't match type `a' with `Dual (Dual a)'
    because a is untouchable
    inside the constraints (b ~ W a3 b2)
      bound at a pattern with constructor
               Wr :: forall a b. a -> Comm b -> Comm (W a b)
    In the pattern: Wr a r
    In an equation for `conn':
        conn (Rd k) (Wr a r) = conn undefined undefined

    Couldn't match type `z' with `n'
      `n' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for `foo' at Simple14.hs:16:17
    because z is untouchable
    inside the constraints (Maybe m ~ Maybe n)
      bound at the polymorphic type `x ~ y => EQ_ z z'
    In the second argument of `eqE', namely `(eqI :: EQ_ m n)'
    In the first argument of `ntI', namely `(`eqE` (eqI :: EQ_ m n))'
    In the expression: ntI (`eqE` (eqI :: EQ_ m n))

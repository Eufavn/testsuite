    Could not deduce (Show a) arising from a use of `bar'
    from the context (Concrete a b)
      bound by the type signature for wib :: Concrete a b => a -> String
      at Gentle.hs:17:1-13
    Possible fix:
      add (Show a) to the context of
        the type signature for wib :: Concrete a b => a -> String
    In the expression: bar x
    In an equation for `wib': wib x = bar x

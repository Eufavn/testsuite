# This test caused a panic in GHC 6.4, but in reality it is user
# error, caused by compiling separate modules in the program using
# different search paths.  GHC gets confused when it can't find a
# module mentioned as a dependency in another interface file.

# If the package format changes, we might have to re-generate pkg.conf
# using the supplied Cabal configuration.

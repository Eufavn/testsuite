    All of the type variables in the constraint `Eq a' are already in scope
	(at least one must be universally quantified here)
    In the type signature: unionSets :: (Eq a) => Set a -> Set a -> Set a
    In the definition of `unionSetB':
	unionSetB (s1 :: Set a) s2
		    = unionSets s1 s2
		    where
			unionSets :: (Eq a) => Set a -> Set a -> Set a
			unionSets a b = a

SHOULD_COMPILE:

tc056           expected output contains a warning about duplicated
                class assertion; is missing in actual output.


SHOULD_FAIL:

tcfail092       expected .stderr is missing

tcfail082       framework failure -- missing other modules.  My problem.

tcfail067       ditto
tcfail062       ditto

tcrun007        won't compile: link failure due to Z1T et al?

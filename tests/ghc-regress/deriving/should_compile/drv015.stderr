drv015.hs:14:0:
    No instances for (Show (g a), Show (f a))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
		   at drv015.hs:(14,0)-(15,25)
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Show (g a), Show (f a))
    When deriving the instance for (Show (Pair1 f g a))

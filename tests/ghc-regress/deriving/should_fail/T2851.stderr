T2851.hs:9:15:
    No instance for (Show (F a))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at T2851.hs:9:15-18
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Show (F a))
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Show (D a))

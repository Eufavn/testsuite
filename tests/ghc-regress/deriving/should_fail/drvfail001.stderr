    No instance for (Show (f (f a)))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
                   at drvfail001.hs:16:33-36
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Show (f (f a)))
      or use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration instead,
         so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Show (SM f a))

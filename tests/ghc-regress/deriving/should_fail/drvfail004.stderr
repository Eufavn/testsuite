drvfail004.hs:5:5:
    Could not deduce (Eq (Foo a b)) from the context (Ord a, Ord b)
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration at drvfail004.hs:5:5
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq (Foo a b)) to the instance declaration superclass context
      or add an instance declaration for (Eq (Foo a b))
    In the instance declaration for `Ord (Foo a b)'

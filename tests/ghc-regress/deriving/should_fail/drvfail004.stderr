drvfail004.hs:5:
    Could not deduce (Eq (Foo a b)) from the context (Ord a, Ord b)
      arising from the instance declaration at drvfail004.hs:5
    Probable fix:
	Add (Eq (Foo a b)) to the instance declaration superclass context
	Or add an instance declaration for (Eq (Foo a b))
    In the instance declaration for `Ord (Foo a b)'

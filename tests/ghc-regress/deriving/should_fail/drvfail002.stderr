    Ambiguous constraint `X T c'
	At least one of the forall'd type variables mentioned by the constraint
	must be reachable from the type after the '=>'
    In the instance declaration for `Show T'

drvfail002.hs:18:0:
    No instance for (X T c)
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
		   at drvfail002.hs:18:0-25
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (X T c)
    When deriving the instance for (Show S)

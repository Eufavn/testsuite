    Couldn't match expected type `Int'
	   against inferred type `a' (a rigid variable)
      `a' is bound by the type signature for `i1' at gadt7.hs:11:8
      Expected type: T Int
      Inferred type: T a
    In the first argument of `(\ t1 y1 -> case t1 of K -> y1)', namely
	`t'
    In the expression: (\ t1 y1 -> case t1 of K -> y1) t y

    Couldn't match the rigid variable `a' against `Int'
      `a' is bound by the type signature for `i1'
      Expected type: Int
      Inferred type: a
    In the second argument of `(\ t1 y1 -> case t1 of K -> y1)', namely `y'
    In the definition of `i1': i1 t y = (\ t1 y1 -> case t1 of K -> ...) t y

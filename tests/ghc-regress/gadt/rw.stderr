    Couldn't match expected type `a' against inferred type `Bool'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
	  the type signature for `readBool' at rw.hs:16:13
      Expected type: a -> Bool
      Inferred type: Bool -> Bool
    In the second argument of `(.)', namely `not'
    In the second argument of `(>>=)', namely `(print . not)'

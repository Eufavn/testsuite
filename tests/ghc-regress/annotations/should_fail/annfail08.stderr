    No instance for (Data.Data.Data (a -> a))
      arising from an annotation at annfail08.hs:9:1-22
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (Data.Data.Data (a -> a))
    In the expression: (id + 1)
    In the annotation: {-# ANN f (id + 1) #-}

annfail08.hs:9:17:
    No instance for (Num (a -> a))

    In the expression: (id + 1)
    In the annotation: {-# ANN f (id + 1) #-}

    Ambiguous type variable `a' in these top-level constraints:
      `Num a' arising from use of `+' at cc004.hs:15
      `GHC.Prim.CReturnable a'
	arising from the result of the _ccall_ to `f' at cc004.hs:15
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      bar :: IO a (bound at cc004.hs:15)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature

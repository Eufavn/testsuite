cc002.hs:10:
    Could not deduce (GHC.Prim.CReturnable (ForeignPtr a))
	from the context ()
    Probable fix:
	Add (GHC.Prim.CReturnable (ForeignPtr a))
	to the type signature(s) for `a'
	Or add an instance declaration for (GHC.Prim.CReturnable (ForeignPtr
								      a))
    arising from the result of the _ccall_ to `a' at cc002.hs:10
    In the definition of `a': _ccall_ a

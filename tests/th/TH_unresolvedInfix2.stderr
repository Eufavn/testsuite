   The operator `:+' [infixl 6] of a section
       must have lower precedence than that of the operand,
         namely `:+' [infixl 6]
       in the section: `:+ N :+ N'
   In the result of the splice:
     $(infixE Nothing plus (Just $ n +? n))
   To see what the splice expanded to, use -ddump-splices
   In the expression: $(infixE Nothing plus (Just $ n +? n))
   In an equation for `expr':
       expr = $(infixE Nothing plus (Just $ n +? n))

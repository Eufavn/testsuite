    Couldn't match expected type `TFn a' with actual type `TFn a0'
    NB: `TFn' is a type function, and may not be injective
    When checking that `x' has the inferred type `forall a1. TFn a1'
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
    In the expression:
      do { let Just x = ...;
           let n = fst x + fst x;
           return () }
    In an equation for `f':
        f = do { let Just x = ...;
                 let n = ...;
                 return () }

    Couldn't match expected type `PVR a1' with actual type `TFn a0'
    Expected type: () -> Maybe (PVR a1)
      Actual type: () -> Maybe (TFn a0)
    In the first argument of `mapM', namely `g'
    In a stmt of a 'do' block: pvs <- mapM g undefined

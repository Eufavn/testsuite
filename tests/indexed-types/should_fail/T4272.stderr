    Couldn't match type `TermFamily (TermFamily x0 x0)'
                  with `TermFamily x0'
    NB: `TermFamily' is a type function, and may not be injective
    Expected type: TermFamily x0 x0
      Actual type: TermFamily a a
    The type variable `x0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `prune', namely `t'
    In the expression: prune t (terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))
    In an equation for `laws':
        laws t = prune t (terms (undefined :: TermFamily a a))

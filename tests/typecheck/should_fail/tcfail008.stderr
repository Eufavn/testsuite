tcfail008.hs:3:5:
    No instance for (Num a0)
      arising from the literal `1'
    Type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      o :: [a0] (bound at tcfail008.hs:3:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    In the first argument of `(:)', namely `1'
    In the expression: 1 : 2
    In an equation for `o': o = 1 : 2

    No instance for (Show (Num a0 => a0))
      arising from a use of `show'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: show ([1, 2, 3] :: [Num a => a])
    In an equation for `f': f = show ([1, 2, 3] :: [Num a => a])

    Couldn't match type `s' with `x'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by

      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a pattern with constructor

    Expected type: (s, x, Int)
      Actual type: (x, s, Int)
    In the return type of a call of `g'
    In the expression: g x id

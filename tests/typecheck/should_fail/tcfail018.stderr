tcfail018.hs:5:10:
    No instance for (Num [t0])
      arising from the literal `1'
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      a :: t0 (bound at tcfail018.hs:5:2)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [t0])
    In the expression: 1
    In a pattern binding: (a : []) = 1

    No instance for (Bar a0 r0)
      arising from a use of `bar'
    The type variables `a0', `r0' are ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `foo', namely `bar'
    In the expression: foo bar
    In an equation for `test': test = foo bar

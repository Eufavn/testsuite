    No instance for (Enum t0)
      arising from the arithmetic sequence `1 .. 10'
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: [1 .. 10]
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: x <- [1 .. 10]
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: then take 5 by x

    Couldn't match type `[a0]' with `a -> t0'
    Expected type: (a -> t0) -> [a] -> [a]
      Actual type: [a0] -> [a0]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    Probable cause: `take' is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a list comprehension: then take 5 by x

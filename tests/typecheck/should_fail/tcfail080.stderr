tcfail080.hs:27:1:
    Ambiguous type variable `c0' in the constraint:
      (Collection c0 a) arising from the ambiguity check for `q'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    When checking that `q'
      has the inferred type `forall (c :: * -> *) a.
                             Collection c a =>
                             a -> Bool'
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous

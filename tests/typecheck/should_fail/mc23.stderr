    No instance for (Enum b0)
      arising from the arithmetic sequence `1 .. 10'
    The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: x <- [1 .. 10]
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then take 5 by x
    In the expression: [x | x <- [1 .. 10], then take 5 by x]

    No instance for (Num b0)

    The type variable `b0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: 1

    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then take 5 by x
    In the expression: [x | x <- [1 .. 10], then take 5 by x]

    Couldn't match type `[a0]' with `a -> b0'
    Expected type: (a -> b0) -> [a] -> t0 a
      Actual type: [a0] -> [a0]
    In the return type of a call of `take'
    Probable cause: `take' is applied to too many arguments
    In the expression: take 5
    In a stmt of a monad comprehension: then take 5 by x

tcfail181.hs:17:9:
    No instance for (Monad m0)
      arising from a use of `foo'
    The type variable `m0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Monad ((->) r) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
      instance Monad IO -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
      instance Monad [] -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
    In the expression: foo
    In the expression: foo {bar = return True}
    In an equation for `wog': wog x = foo {bar = return True}

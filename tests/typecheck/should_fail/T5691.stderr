    Couldn't match type `p' with `PrintRuleInterp'
    Expected type: p a
      Actual type: PrintRuleInterp a
    In the pattern: f :: p a
    In an equation for `test': test (f :: p a) = MkPRI $ printRule_ f
    In the instance declaration for `Test PrintRuleInterp'

T5691.hs:24:10:
    No instance for (Monad RecDecParser)
      arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Monad RecDecParser)
    In the instance declaration for `MonadPlus RecDecParser'

    Couldn't match type `x' with `x1'
      `x' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the instance declaration at tcfail065.hs:28:18
      `x1' is a rigid type variable bound by
           the type signature for setX :: x1 -> X x -> X x
           at tcfail065.hs:29:3
    Expected type: X x1
      Actual type: X x
    In the return type of a call of `X'
    In the expression: X x

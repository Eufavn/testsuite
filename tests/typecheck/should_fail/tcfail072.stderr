tcfail072.hs:23:13:
    Could not deduce (Ord p0, Ord q0) arising from a use of `g'
    from the context (Ord p, Ord q)
      bound by the type signature for
                 g :: (Ord p, Ord q) => AB p q -> Bool
      at tcfail072.hs:22:6-38
    The type variables `p0', `q0' are ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: g A
    In an equation for `g': g (B _ _) = g A

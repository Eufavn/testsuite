tcfail010.hs:3:17:
    No instance for (Num [t0])
      arising from a use of `+'
    Type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      q :: [t0] -> [t0] (bound at tcfail010.hs:3:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    In the expression: z + 2
    In the expression: \ (y : z) -> z + 2
    In an equation for `q': q = \ (y : z) -> z + 2

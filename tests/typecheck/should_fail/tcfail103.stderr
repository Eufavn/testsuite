    Couldn't match type `s' with `t'
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for g :: ST s Int at tcfail103.hs:15:9
      `t' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for f :: ST t Int at tcfail103.hs:11:1
    Expected type: ST s Int
      Actual type: ST t Int
    In the return type of a call of `readSTRef'
    In the expression: readSTRef v

    Couldn't match expected type `a' with actual type `HsDoc id0'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for
            gfoldl' :: (forall a1 b. c (a1 -> b) -> a1 -> c b)

    In the pattern: DocParagraph hsDoc
    In a case alternative:

    In the expression:

    Could not deduce (E [t0]) arising from a use of `eop'
    from the context (E [Int])
      bound by the type signature for bar :: E [Int] => () -> ()
      at FailDueToGivenOverlapping.hs:27:1-23
    The type variable `t0' is ambiguous
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the expression: eop [undefined]
    In an equation for `bar': bar _ = eop [undefined]

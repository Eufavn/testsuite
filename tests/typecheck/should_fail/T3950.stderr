    Couldn't match type `Id p0 x0' with `Id p'
    Expected type: w (Id p)
      Actual type: Sealed (Id p0 x0)
    In the first argument of `Just', namely rp'
    In the expression: Just rp'
    In an equation for `rp':
        rp _
          = Just rp'
          where
              rp' :: Sealed (Id p x)
              rp' = undefined

tcfail040.hs:19:5:
    No instance for (ORD a0)
      arising from a use of `<<'
    The type variable `a0' is ambiguous
    Possible fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `(===)', namely `(<<)'
    In the expression: (<<) === (<<)
    In an equation for `f': f = (<<) === (<<)
